# Data Collection Tool for Typhoid fever Diagnosis

I designed a data collection tool using google forms.
This tool aims to collect different symptoms whilst checking for the severity level. 
Also, the tool is dedicated to health care practitioner with access to patients data
The following were considered for the severity level of the disease:
- Duration of the time the patient has spent within the healthcare facility.
- How long the patient has had a particular symptoms.
- The complications between time of admission and time of discharge.

In addition,
 - The forms can be translated to other languages.
